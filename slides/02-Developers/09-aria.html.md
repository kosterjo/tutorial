        For this exercise, we will focus on one small part of WAI-ARIA called landmark regions.
        landmark regions help screen reader users do what others do when they
        glance at a page, i.e., see its different parts from a bird's-eye view. They also
        make it easy to move the screen reader's reading cursor to different locations on the page.
        Instructions for this exercise are in the comment block in the editor below.

      code: |

        <h3>ARIA Landmarks Exercise</h3>
        <!--
             1. Turn on VoiceOver.
             2. Press ctrl-opt-u.
             3. Press right arrow until you hear "Landmarks".
             4. Press down arrow to read the landmark list.
             5. Press enter to move the VoiceOver reading cursor
                to the beginning of one of the landmark regions.
        -->
        How many landmarks did you find on the page?
        <input type="text" id="landmarks">

      assertion: |
        var link = document.getElementById('landmarks');
        assert(
          link.value === '3' || link.value === 'three',
          "That is not the right number of landmarks on the page!"
        );


      note: |

        There are several types of landmark roles. Some of them are:

        - `<main>`,`<div role="main">` -- Equivalent to “directing the gaze” of 
        the screen reader user. Should contain only the primary content of the 
        page.

        - `<nav>`,`<div role="navigation">` -- contains a set of links or 
        elements for navigating the site

        - `<aside>`, `<div role="complementary">` - content that supplements 
        the main content

        - `<div role="search">` - search widget

        - `<header>`, `<div role="banner">` - the banner of the page

        - `<footer>`, `<div role="contentinfo">` - information about the page 
        such as copyright, help, and information links that appear in the 
        footer

        **[Other ARIA roles are documented in the WCAG 
        spec.](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#document_structure_roles)**

ARIA or **[Accessible Rich Internet
Applications](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)** provides a framework of 
roles, properties, and guidelines to help
develop accessible user interactions.
